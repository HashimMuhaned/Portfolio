    description:
      "n8n workflow  is designed to create a Business WhatsApp AI RAG  Chatbot.",
    detailedDescription: `How it works:Webhook Setup: The workflow begins by setting up webhooks for verification and response. The Verify webhook receives GET requests and sends back a verification code, while the Respond webhook handles incoming POST requests from Meta regarding WhatsApp messages.
Message Handling: Once a message is received, the workflow checks if the incoming JSON contains a user message. If it does, the message is processed further; otherwise, a generic response is sent.
AI Agent Interaction: The user's message is passed to the AI Agent node, which uses a conversational agent with a predefined system message tailored for an electronics store. This ensures that the AI provides accurate and professional responses based on the knowledge base.
Knowledge Base Utilization: The AI Agent references a knowledge base stored in Qdrant, a vector database. Documents from Google Drive are downloaded, vectorized using OpenAI embeddings, and stored in Qdrant for retrieval during conversations.
Response Generation: The AI Agent generates a response using the OpenAI chat model (gpt-4o-mini) and sends it back to the user via WhatsApp.
Set up steps:

1. Create Qdrant Collection:
- Update the QDRANTURL and COLLECTION variables in the workflow.
- Use the Create collection HTTP request node to initialize the collection in Qdrant.

2. Vectorize Documents:
- Configure the Get folder and Download Files nodes to fetch documents from a specified Google Drive folder.
- Use the Embeddings OpenAI node to generate embeddings for the downloaded files.
- Store the vectorized documents in Qdrant using the Qdrant Vector Store node.

3. Configure Webhooks:
- Ensure both Verify and Respond webhooks have the same URL.
- Set the Verify webhook to use the GET HTTP method and the Respond webhook to use the POST HTTP method.

4. Set Up AI Agent:
- Define the system prompt for the AI Agent, specifying guidelines for product information, technical support, customer service, and knowledge base usage.
- Link the AI Agent to the OpenAI chat model and configure any additional tools as needed.

5. Test Workflow:
- Trigger the workflow manually using the When clicking ‘Test workflow’ node to ensure all components are functioning correctly.
- Monitor the flow of data through the nodes and verify that responses are being generated and sent accurately.

By following these steps, the workflow will be fully operational, enabling a robust AI-powered chatbot capable of handling customer inquiries via WhatsApp.

    title: "Appointment Scheduling",
    description:
      "appointment scheduling AI agent which can take enquiries from prospective customers and help them book an appointment",
    detailedDescription: `Where no appointment is booked, the agent is able to send follow-up messages to re-engage leads. After an appointment is booked, the agent can reschedule or even cancel the booking for the user without human intervention.

For small outfits, this workflow could contribute the necessary "man-power" required to increase business sales.

How it works:

The customer sends an enquiry via SMS to trigger our workflow. For this trigger, we'll use a Twilio webhook. The prospective or existing customer's number is logged in an Airtable Base which we'll be using to track all our enquiries.

Next, the message is sent to our AI Agent who can reply to the user and decide if an appointment booking can be made. The reply is made via SMS using Twilio.

A scheduled trigger which runs every day checks our chat logs for a list of prospective customers who have yet to book an appointment but still show interest. This list is sent to our AI Agent to formulate a personalised follow-up message to each lead and ask them if they want to continue with the booking.

The follow-up interaction is logged so as to not send too many messages to the customer.

Requirements:

- A Twilio account to receive customer messages.
- An Airtable account and Base to use as our datastore for enquiries.
- Cal.com account to use as our scheduling service.
- OpenAI account for our AI model.

Customising this workflow:

Not using Airtable? Swap this out for your CRM of choice such as HubSpot or your own service.

Not using Cal.com? Swap this out for API-enabled services such as Acuity Scheduling or your own service.`,

4. The Embeddings Google Gemini node generates embeddings for each text chunk using the text-embedding-004 model.
5. The Pinecone Vector Store node indexes the text chunks and their embeddings in a specified Pinecone index.
6. The Chat Trigger node receives user questions through a chat interface. The user's question is passed to an AI Agent node.
7. The AI Agent node uses a Vector Store Tool node, linked to a Pinecone Vector Store node in query mode, to retrieve relevant text chunks from Pinecone based on the user's question.
8. The AI Agent sends the retrieved information and the user's question to the Google Gemini Chat Model (gemini-pro).
9. The Google Gemini Chat Model generates a comprehensive and informative answer based on the retrieved documents.
10. A Window Buffer Memory node connected to the AI Agent provides short-term memory, allowing for more natural and context-aware conversations.`,
